# Solita Strategy Document

## Executive Summary

Solita is committed to helping organizations craft effective strategies that are adaptive, insightful, and human-centric. We understand that strategy is not a static concept but a dynamic process that requires continuous learning, experimentation, and adaptation. This document outlines our approach to strategy and the services we offer to help businesses navigate the complexities of strategic planning and execution.

## Introduction

In a world of constant change, having a clear and adaptive strategy is crucial for any business to succeed. At Solita, we believe that strategy should guide an organization's most significant decisions and daily tasks. It should be continuously updated to reflect the changing world, yet maintain a long-term orientation to avoid costly back-and-forths. 

## Our Approach

Our approach to strategy is based on three key principles:

1. **Design Thinking**: We use design thinking to help organizations craft strategies that are human-centric and adaptive.

2. **Human Insight**: We leverage human insight to understand the needs and behaviors of customers and stakeholders, which informs the strategic choices we make.

3. **Adaptive Strategy Work**: We believe that no strategy survives its first contact with reality. Therefore, we focus on creating strategies that are flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances.

## Our Services

### Adaptive Strategy

We facilitate an insightful strategy process where we identify strategy hypotheses and related uncertainties. We then select the most critical ones for co-design and experimentation, using the lessons learned to prioritize and make choices.

### Strategic Adaptation

We help build an adaptive strategy by introducing design thinking and tools to your strategy work. We focus on hypotheses, experiments, learning, scenarios, agile, and data-driven approaches.

### Strategic Human and Cultural Insight

We define the big picture to support strategic choices and decisions. We identify current and hidden customer groups and analyze their key differences. We interpret major trends and phenomena transforming business and how they change the lives and behavior of customers.

### Challenging Your Thinking

We provide an external viewpoint to challenge your organizationâ€™s management and strategy team. We help you envision your dream position and guide you on how to achieve it.

### Strategic Theme Analysis and Experimentations

We analyze the chosen strategic theme (e.g., sustainability or circular economy) and use customer insight, experiments, and simulations to learn about its effects on your business. We then concretize findings into new service businesses.

### Customer-Driven Technology and Data Strategy

We collect customer and business needs and turn them into technology choices and new services. We start from the grassroots level by building customer insight and see the choices through to roadmap prioritization.
